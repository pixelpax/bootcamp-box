Use the @notes-reviewer agent to check out what's been done so far in the unit, and compose a custom lesson.

You should more or less copy the most challenging lesson from the section for them, if there's code, you should base your new exercise on the code from the master lesson, but modify it to keep it fresh.

If you can integrate subjects from other lessons, you should, especially things they're still solidifying.

Make sure not to review things they've reviewed recently.

Ask them some quiz questions before and after the coding challenge and/or invite them to discuss earlier topics in more detail with you.
