Use the @notes-reviewer agent to check out what's been done so far across the entirety of their repo.

Ask the student 5-10 faster questions, one at a time. Questions should come from everything the student has learned, but focused on recent material, weak material, and material that hasn't been reviewed recently. Could include made-up in-discussion code snippets, but should be discussion format and a focus on conceptual knowledge, no need for them to edit or author runnable code here.
